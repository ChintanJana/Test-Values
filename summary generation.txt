  "original_text": "Getting 999 Error Code: Site data getting update on Solar.Web at intermittent days from March 2024. 2 Inverters (Primo 6.0-1 (1): 32763243, Primo 6.0-1 (2): 32763239 ) are there for the site.\n\n

Perform the following steps to try and resolve this issue:\n
1. On the inverter display, go to “Setup” -> “DATCOM” to check the DATCOM status. If it shows an error, you may need to address connectivity issues.\n
2. Ensure your router and internet connection are stable. Restart your router and check if the connection between the inverter and Solar.web is re-established.\n
3. If the system remains offline, de-energize the inverter (turn off AC and DC switches), wait a few minutes, and then turn it back on.\n
4. Ensure that your inverter's firmware is up to date. If you recently updated settings or firmware, verify that all configurations are correct.\n
5. Ensure the inverter's physical connections are secure.",
